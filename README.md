## Overview

This project is a distraction-free viewer for the iconic "Friends" TV series. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it provides a clean interface to browse and watch episodes without the interruption of ads or pop-ups that plague many streaming sites.

## Features

- **Clean, Ad-Free Interface**: A minimalist design focused on content
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between color schemes with automatic preference saving
- **Season & Episode Navigation**: Easily browse all seasons and episodes
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized viewing experience across devices
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: No page refreshes needed when navigating
- **Custom SPA Routing**: Smooth transitions between different sections

## Technical Implementation

### Pure Vanilla JavaScript

This project was purposely built without any frameworks or libraries as a personal challenge to deepen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts. This approach allowed me to:

- Implement custom state management
- Build a routing system from scratch
- Handle DOM manipulation directly
- Manage event listeners efficiently

### Design Approach

The application uses:

- JSON data structures for episode information
- Custom routing for single-page application behavior
- Local storage for user preferences
- Dynamic content rendering
- Custom event handling

## Project Background

This project stemmed from personal frustration with existing streaming options for "Friends" that were cluttered with intrusive advertisements. What began as a solution to enhance my own viewing experience evolved into a comprehensive project that helped sharpen my web development skills.
