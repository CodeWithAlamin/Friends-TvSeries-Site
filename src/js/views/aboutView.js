          <h1 class="primary-heading">About This Project üåü</h1>
          <p class="explanation">
            Welcome to the Friends TV Series Viewer! This project was born from a simple desire: 
            to create a clean, ad-free platform for enjoying the iconic show "Friends." 
            Frustrated with intrusive ads and pop-ups on other streaming sites, 
            I developed this minimalist space where fellow fans can enjoy the series without interruptions.
          </p>

          <h2 class="secondary-heading">Behind the Scenes</h2>
          <p class="explanation">
            This personal project helped me refine my JavaScript skills and apply my web development 
            knowledge in a practical context. From responsive UI design to implementing dynamic content 
            loading and custom routing, each component presented valuable learning opportunities.
          </p>

          <h2 class="secondary-heading">Technical Approach</h2>
          <p class="explanation">
            The site is built entirely with HTML, CSS (Sass), and Vanilla JavaScript - deliberately 
            avoiding frameworks to challenge myself and deepen my understanding of core web development 
            principles. This approach allowed me to implement custom state management, SPA routing, 
            and efficient DOM manipulation from scratch.
          </p>

          <h2 class="secondary-heading">Content Sources</h2>
          <p class="explanation">

            and vidsrc.cc). This project serves as an interface to access this content and does not host, 
            store, or distribute any copyrighted material.
