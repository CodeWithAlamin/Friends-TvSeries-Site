        <h1 class="primary-heading">About This Project🌟</h1>
        <p class="explanation">
          Welcome to the Friends TV Series website! This project emerged
          from a simple desire: to create an ad-free platform for enjoying
          every episode of the iconic show "Friends." Fed up with ads and
          pop-ups on other streaming sites, I crafted a clean,
          user-friendly space for fellow fans to enjoy the series
          uninterrupted.

        <h2 class="secondary-heading">Behind the Scenes🎬</h2>
        <p class="explanation">
          This is a personal endeavor that let me refine my JavaScript
          skills and put my web development knowledge into action. From UI
          design to dynamic content loading, every step was a valuable
          learning experience.
        </p>

        <h2 class="secondary-heading">Technical Approach🛠️</h2>
        <p class="explanation">
          The site is constructed with HTML, CSS (Sass), and Vanilla
          JavaScript. I chose to
          build it from scratch, without frameworks, to challenge myself
          and deepen my understanding of web development.
        </p>

        <h2 class="secondary-heading">Video sources</h2>
        <p class="explanation">
          Video links were sourced from a 3rd party public google drive shared by a user named: (hajxh1) and the drive link is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JqyfZKdkhmgymOVxZbfePG6XqQGUGoZF

        
        </p>
        <p>
        It is not a commercial project and the videos are not hosted on this site. The videos are streamed from the google drive directly.
